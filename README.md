quadcopter project: a collaboration
Ryan Chan
Leighton Chen
Justin Lee

attempting to build and code a quadcopter from scratch. 

9/15/15 UPDATE:
We are now actively able to control 4 motors using GPIO pins though Python programs. 
We can also read real time acecelerometer/ gyrometer outputs in python.
